        "Pressure diffusion in porous media refers to the process by which pressure is transferred through a porous material, such as rock or soil. Porous media are materials that have interconnected voids, or pores, that allow fluids to flow through them. The flow of fluid through porous media is governed by the laws of physics and can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the diffusion equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of pressure diffusion, the PDE that describes the process is the pressure diffusion equation. This equation describes how pressure changes in the porous media as a function of time and position. The equation takes into account factors such as the permeability of the porous material, the viscosity of the fluid, and the boundary conditions (e.g. the pressure at the inlet and outlet of the porous material).\n",
        "\n",
        "The pressure diffusion equation is a important equation in many fields like Petroleum Engineering, Hydrology and environmental engineering. In petroleum engineering, it is used to predict the flow of oil and gas through porous rock formations, which is important for the design and optimization of oil and gas wells. In hydrology, it is used to model the flow of water through porous soil, which is important for understanding the water balance of watersheds and for managing groundwater resources. In environmental engineering, it is used to model the transport of pollutants through soil, which is important for understanding the fate and transport of pollutants in the environment.\n",

In the context of solving the 1D pressure diffusion equation, explicit methods such as the Forward Euler method have a stability constraint known as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. This condition states that the time step used in the simulation must be small enough in relation to the spatial step in order for the solution to remain stable. This can be a significant limitation in practice, as it can make the simulation very computationally expensive.\n",
